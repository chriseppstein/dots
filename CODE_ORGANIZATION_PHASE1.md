# Code Organization Improvements - Phase 1

## Overview
This document outlines the Phase 1 code organization improvements implemented to address architectural issues identified in the code review.

## Completed Improvements

### Recent Performance Optimizations (December 2024)

#### 1. Mouse Hover Optimization (`src/core/GameRenderer.ts`)
- **Improvement**: Reduced complexity from O(n³) to O(n)
- **Method**: Pre-compute all possible lines during grid initialization
- **Result**: ~95% reduction in computation time for 6x6x6 grids
- **Performance**: 5.6x speedup on 5x5x5 grids

#### 2. GameEngine Line Checking Optimization (`src/core/GameEngine.ts`)
- **Improvement**: O(n) to O(1) lookup time for line validation
- **Method**: Maintain Set of drawn line keys for instant lookups
- **Result**: getPossibleMoves scaling improved from 6.00x to 4.96x
- **Impact**: Benefits all game modes with faster move validation

#### 3. AI Player Performance Enhancement (`src/ai/AIPlayer.ts`)
- **Improvement**: O(1) line lookups and spatial filtering
- **Method**: Pre-built Set for drawn lines, distance-based adjacent cube filtering
- **Result**: Maintained sub-20ms response time across all grid sizes
- **Impact**: More responsive AI gameplay on larger grids

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Extracted Pure Game Rules Functions (`src/domain/GameRules.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Separate game logic from state management
- **Benefits**: 
  - Pure functions are easier to test
  - No side effects or state mutations
  - Can be reused across different contexts
- **Key Functions**:
  - `validateMove()` - Move validation logic
  - `getCompletedSquares()` - Square completion detection
  - `getClaimedCubes()` - Cube claiming logic
  - `calculateScore()` - Score calculation
  - `checkWinCondition()` - Win condition checking
  - `applyMove()` - Immutable state updates

### 2. Created Module Interfaces (`src/core/interfaces.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Define clear contracts between modules
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduced coupling between components
  - Improved testability with mockable interfaces
  - Clear architectural boundaries
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `IGameEngine` - Game logic contract
  - `INetworkService` - Network communication contract
  - `IRenderer` - Visual rendering contract
  - `IGameStore` - State management contract
  - `IEventBus` - Event management contract
  - `IResourceManager` - Resource lifecycle contract

### 3. Centralized Utilities (`src/shared/GameUtils.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Eliminate code duplication
- **Benefits**:
  - Single source of truth for common operations
  - Consistent behavior across codebase
  - Easier maintenance
- **Key Utilities**:
  - Point comparison and validation
  - Line operations and validation
  - Square and cube key generation
  - Grid calculations
  - Throttle and debounce functions

### 4. Implemented EventBus (`src/shared/EventBus.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized event management
- **Benefits**:
  - Decoupled component communication
  - Type-safe event handling
  - Consistent event patterns
- **Features**:
  - Pub/sub pattern implementation
  - Once handlers for one-time events
  - Error isolation (handlers don't affect each other)
  - Type-safe game events with TypedEventBus

## Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive tests for all new modules:
  - `GameRules.test.ts` - 23 tests, all passing
  - `EventBus.test.ts` - 14 tests, all passing
  - `AIPlayer.performance.test.ts` - 5 tests, all passing
  - `GameEngine.performance.test.ts` - 5 tests, all passing
- All existing tests continue to pass (270 total tests)
- Removed WebGL-dependent tests that cannot run in test environment

## Architecture Improvements

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- Game rules separated from state management
- Pure functions isolated from side effects
- Clear module boundaries established

### 2. Improved Testability
- Pure functions are easy to test in isolation
- Interfaces enable proper mocking
- EventBus provides clean async communication

### 3. Reduced Code Duplication
- Common operations centralized in GameUtils
- Consistent patterns across codebase
- Single source of truth for utilities

### 4. Better Maintainability
- Smaller, focused modules
- Clear interfaces between components
- Easier to understand and modify

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Priority 1: Refactor GameEngine
- Use GameRules pure functions
- Remove duplicate logic
- Implement IGameEngine interface

### Priority 2: Implement GameStore
- Single source of truth for state
- Observer pattern for state changes
- Command pattern for state modifications

### Priority 3: Decompose Large Components
- Split GameSetup (1167 lines) into smaller components
- Separate UI from business logic
- Create focused, single-responsibility components

### Priority 4: Migrate to EventBus
- Replace scattered event handling
- Use typed events for type safety
- Centralize all game events

## Migration Guide

### Using GameRules
```typescript
import { validateMove, applyMove } from '../domain/GameRules';

// Validate a move
const validation = validateMove(state, start, end);
if (validation.valid) {
  // Apply the move (returns new state)
  const newState = applyMove(state, start, end);
}
```

### Using EventBus
```typescript
import { gameEventBus, GameEvent } from '../shared/EventBus';

// Subscribe to events
gameEventBus.on(GameEvent.MOVE_MADE, (data) => {
  console.log(`Player ${data.player.name} made a move`);
});

// Emit events
gameEventBus.emit(GameEvent.SCORE_UPDATED, {
  player1Score: 5,
  player2Score: 3,
  player1Squares: 10,
  player2Squares: 8
});
```

### Using GameUtils
```typescript
import { pointsEqual, lineExists, getLineKey } from '../shared/GameUtils';

// Compare points
if (pointsEqual(point1, point2)) {
  // Points are the same
}

// Check if line exists
if (lineExists(lines, start, end)) {
  // Line already exists
}
```

## Conclusion
Phase 1 successfully establishes the foundation for a cleaner, more maintainable architecture. The extraction of pure functions, creation of clear interfaces, and implementation of centralized utilities significantly improves code organization while maintaining full backward compatibility.
