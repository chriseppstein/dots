    // 1. Open the game in browser
    // 2. Click "Online Multiplayer" 
    // 3. Enter player name
    // 4. Click "Create Game"

    // When room.players.size === 2 && !room.started, the server immediately:
    // 1. Creates GameEngine  
    // 2. Sets room.started = true
    // 3. Emits 'game-started' event to both players
    
    // This happens when the SECOND player joins, which triggers immediate game start.
    // But Player 1 should be in waiting room until Player 2 actually joins.
    
    // The problem might be that in real usage, player 1 creates room and waits,
    // but in tests we simulate both players joining quickly, so we don't see the waiting state.
